# Bugfixes
If any temporary bugs are found within Satellite that require a workaround, this is a location to put the playbooks to implement those workarounds.

## Creating a bugfix
1) Create a file with a relevant name
1) Enter in a task list that will implement the workaround
1) Make sure all tasks are tagged with `always`. The import task will take care of filtering down to the correct tag
